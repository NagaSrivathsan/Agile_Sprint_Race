Agile Sprint Race Game

This project is a fun and interactive way to understand Agile and DevOps.
Each task is a runner moving across a sprint track (To Do → In Progress → Done).
The first task to reach Done wins the sprint! 🎉
CI/CD with GitHub Actions ensures the game is automatically deployed on GitHub Pages after every update.
